# preview production build
npm start

Project Structure
/public         → Static assets (images, icons)
/pages          → Next.js pages (routes)
/components     → Reusable UI components
/styles         → Global styles and Tailwind config

Approach & Decisions

Kept the design simple and clean with reusable components

Used Tailwind CSS for faster iteration and responsiveness

Leveraged Next.js static rendering for performance and SEO

Used TypeScript for safer code and easier scaling

Known Issues

Deadline pressure: Some design polish and accessibility checks were rushed due to time constraints

Minor optimizations (SEO/meta tags, content flexibility) left for future improvement

Would you like me to also add a short “Deployment” section (e.g., how you deployed it to Vercel) since it’s already live?
